Chris: “Look you scoffers, marvel and vanish away because I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will never believe, even if someone were to explain it to you.” Acts 13:41
Hello friends and neighbors and welcome to Apocrypals. It’s the podcast where two non-believers read through the bible but we’re not….you know...a-holes about it. My name is Chris Sims and with me as always is the other set of footprints, Benito Cereno. Benito how are you today?

Benito: Chris I’m excellent, how're you this very good Holy Week?

Chris: I’m very excited because this is our first episode of Apocrypals and I am very much looking forward to talking about the book of Acts, which is pretty amazing.

Benito: It is pretty good, I feel like we made a good choice for our first book, but I did want to ask - do you know what today is, the day that we're recording here during Holy Week? Do you know what today’s name is?

Chris: Let’s see, it’s not Ash Wednesday because that already happened

Benito: That’s the one at the beginning of Lent, yea
 
Chris: And it’s not Palm Sunday

Benito: That was this past Sunday

Chris: Yea and it’s not Good Friday because it’s Wednesday, so no what is today?

Benito: Today is called Spy Wednesday. It’s Spy Wednesday.

Chris: I’m sorry?

Benito: It’s Spy Wednesday. S-P-Y “spy” and it is traditionally the day on which Judas Iscariot turns Jesus over to the Romans, so the word “spy” in this case indicates an ambush or a betrayal. So today’s Spy Wednesday. Tomorrow - do you know what tomorrow is called?

Chris: Tomorrow is Thursday

Benito: Yep

Chris: So that would be...is it Maundy Thursday?

Benito: It is Maundy Thursday, which is the perfect church-sanctioned day to go get your pedi, is tomorrow because it’s the day you celebrate Jesus washing his disciples’ feet, so go get your pedi on tomorrow.
Chris: Then we have Good Friday and Bad Saturday

Benito: Bad Saturday. Usually Holy Saturday, but yea Bad Saturday. Huddle House Saturday, we used to call it in my teens, because it was the day in which all the apostles went and huddled in a house because they were afraid because Jesus was dead and they didn’t know what was going to happen.

Chris: I am pretty sure from reading the menu at the Huddle House restaurant which is like a third rate Waffle House that that is not the inspiration for the name “Huddle House”.

Benito: No i think not. “Here take this waffle that is given unto you. Take and eat all of it.” No I don’t think so.

Chris: I don’t need a special occasion to take all the waffle and eat of it. And then of course there's Easter Sunday which is not today, and it’s probably not today when you’re listening to this, but it is time for us to talk about the Bible a little bit. And this and it’s good that you bing all this up, because today as we mentioned we are talking about the book of Acts, which takes place immediately after Easter Sunday.

Benito: Uh pretty much it’s in the aftermath of that, it’s within a month of Easter, yea

Chris: Now if you want to hear about why we chose the book of Acts we do go through it in detail on our zero episode where we also talk about our history with the church and religion in general and we kind of lay out our plan and talk about the version of the Bible we’re using but for anyone who just skipped ahead and just wanted to get to the good good Bible discussion this book study that we’re doing Benito this was your choice. Why did you choose to start us off with the book of Acts instead of a Genesis or even a Matthew?

Benito: When we first started this I didn’t realize we were going to be doing this as a podcast, but uh i picked this one because - 

Chris: Don’t put that on me, this was your idea - 

Benito: It was my idea and the podcast was also my idea, that’s true, but it was one of those things where once we got into it I was like “oh this is a podcast right this is a podcast” but I picked it because I thought we should start with the New Testament, it’s just a little bit more familiar, a little bit easier to read, also most of the New Testament books are shorter than many Old Testament books, it would feature a cast of characters you would mostly be familiar with but also like I said it’s got action right there in the title, we've got not one but two evil wizards and there are number of other things that I thought would appeal to your particular sensibilities, so I thought this would be good a one to start with even though it is an explicit sequel which is maybe a little bit weird for the very first thing to start with part two but we did it.

Chris: Odds are pretty good that if you are listening to a podcast about the Bible you’re at least passingly familiar with the story of Jesus Christ and look you probably know what happens on Good Friday, you probably know what happens on Easter Sunday, those are the big ones

Benito: Those are the big ones yea

Chris: Probably know what happens on Christmas. Not a lot between those honestly there's some stuff there's combing the seas there's walking on water there's feeding the masses, he does all that

Benito: Yep and you know we will get here eventually we'll get to read four traditional versions of that and then multiple ones for people who are like “why doesn’t anyone talk about what he did when he was a toddler” we can get to those too but we’ll have plenty of time to talk about Jesus

Chris: Oh, let me introduce you to Thomas

Benito: Indeed but for now I thought we would start with these guys 

Chris: Right so let's talk about Acts. Let’s get into the book of Acts. This was a surprising one for me because you know most people who have a more passing familiarity with the Bible and I‘m including myself in this you know of feel like oh right you know Jesus is crucified, resurrected from the dead, ascends to heaven, and the rest of the New Testament is just letters, it's epistilary books, it’s Romans, it’s Corinthians, it’s all that and then you get to Revelations which gets wild. I didn’t realize there was going to be a lot of activity in the post-Jesus pre-letters section of the Bible that would also involve other people doing miracles. That was the most surprising things about Acts for me.

Benito: Yea alright I mean yea it’s the transition book. It’s the transition from well Jesus is gone from the earth physically, what happens now? Right? And also you know it has its own thesis to it, right, there's why’s the book of Acts written? Because its stands for question, and that question is, if Christianity is a Jewish religion in origin why’re most of Christians Gentiles? That’s the question that this book basically sets out to answer, like it’s an origin story for why most Christians are not actually Jewish, and you can see that in this structure of the book where all the action starts centered in Jerusalem and then it kind of spirals outward. You go from Jerusalem to Sumeria to Syria out into Asia Minor and then into Europe and then finally the book ends with the most influential Christian at then time literally sitting in the seat of the pagan empire, continuing his mission without hindrance right like that’s the end of the book. So you see the growth that literally follows a pattern like if you look at a map you can see the way that it’s like concentric circle spreading outward and that's kind of what the book is about. So yea like I said this book is an explicit sequel. One way we know that is because it starts it literally starts with “I wrote the first narrative Theophilus about all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day he was taken up, after He had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen.” So it literally stars with him saying remember what I did in my first book. And one way that we know that - 

Chris: It’s like it plays under the credits, it’s like a recap

Benito: Previously in “The Bible” yea so this is one way that we know that the author of the book of Acts is the same guy as the author of the gospel according to Luke, right

Chris: Wait wait wait question - so why is it Luke and not Matthew, err, John, because John is the last one, John is the one that comes immediately before

Benito: John is the last one, I don’t exactly know why the gospels get ordered the way that they are. It’s not chronological, Mark is the earliest of the gospels for sure Matthew and Luke would have been roughly contemporary, John would have been the latest but we know Luke and Acts are the same author through this like textual analysis we can see they use the same kind of vocabulary, ans phraseology that kind of stuff but they're both addressed to this guy Theophilus right, they’re both written, basically as not quite a letter, but they're written to this guy. They say “Hey Theophilus here's a book I wrote for you.” Who is Theophilus? We do not know. I know Chris you don’t speak Greek but you might be able to put it together

Chris: Oh I can guess this one: “theo” meaning “religion”

Benito: Or “god”

Chris: And “philius” meaning “a lover of”

Benito: Exactly

Chris: So is Theophilus a specific person or is he just saying “hey fans this is, you know i’m back, back once again”

Benito: You have literally hit on a question that people have been arguing for like two thousand years. The question is, is Theophilus a real person, is it a nickname, is it a code name, is it a name for like “what’s up squad fam” yeah basically is that what's going on here at the beginning? We don’t know yeah it just means a lover of god, and it could have and it could have been a real person's name that is lost to history, it could be a code name because he's a secret Christian, it could be a nickname, we don't know, but it is one of those things that ties the two books together. 

Chris: So it’s either “what's up squad” or it's like when Bruno Mars tells Julio to get the stretch. 

Benito: Yes, it’s like that.

Chris: It’s a character we don’t know a lot about.

Benito: Exactly, exactly. A character that we otherwise know nothing about. As a result both of these books since very very early days have been attributed to Luke. And the question is who is Luke? He’s a name that we see appear a couple of times throughout Paul's letters. For example, Colossians 4:14 refers to Luke the dearly loved physician, which is the only place we learn Luke’s day job, right, he's not an Evangelist by day, he’s a physician. He’s again in 2 Timothy 4:11 where he says only Luke is with me, this is Paul talking, bring Mark with you which is believed to be the Mark of Mark the Evangelist, and then in the book of Philemon one you don't hear a lot about, verse 24 which doesn't even have chapters it’s so short, he says “Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers”. So he's mentioned a couple times in Paul's letter, so he refers to them, yeah so we see Luke in a couple of those places. So the question is, why do we assume that these books are written by a guy that was friends with Paul? I don’t know if you noticed this when you were reading Chris, there are five different sections in the book of Acts where it suddenly just, like, low-key slips into first-person, where there's places where it's like “and then we sailed here” “and then we went here” “and then we were put in prison” and you know that kind of stuff. There’s five sections where that happens.

Chris: I did not 

Benito: Yeah well those first person passages are what has led people to assume that these books must be more or less first-person accounts, or at least you know worst case second hand accounts, of things that happened to a friend and companion of Paul. Luke becomes the good candidate because as a physician he would have been literate, for one thing, which was not a guarantee at that time. Also Luke has a Greco-Roman name, right, the name “Luke” is derived ultimately from the Latin name Lucius. The fact that he has a Greco-Roman name is a good sign because the Book of Luke and also the book of Acts are largely concerned with and targeted towards Gentile audiences, and his phraseology, his terminology, those kind of things within the text point to the idea that this is a Greek guy, not a Jewish guy, who's writing these things.

Chris: Here’s my question. Why wouldn't it be Paul? Is it because there’s discussion of Paul in this one? And the reason I ask is this - not to get too far afield right here at the beginning before we’ve even gotten past chapter 1 verse 1 of this book, but we know in the Apocryphal acts where the homie Simon Magus comes back that Peter and Paul in that book are the ones who go see Nero and have an encounter with Simon Magus, so it is not mentioned, I believe, that Paul goes with Peter on the boat in this one, so it seems like he would be a likely candidate for the companion.

Benito: Yeah, uh, no

Chris: So that’s a flat no
Benito: Yeah the acts of Peter and Paul which we’ll get to later are considerably later than this right - 

Chris: I mean yea I’m not surprised

Benito: I mean one of the reasons that they're apocryphal is that they were written like a full three centuries after this, probably like around the time that canon was being established basically. 

Chris: I don't know what you want to do with this podcast but I'm planning on solving everything that has been asked for sure 

Benito: Yeah I feel like that's a good thing we should set up front. We should say “hey guys I know everyone's been talking about this for two thousand years or more, if we include the Hebrew scriptures we're going back four thousand years maybe, suddenly we're going to solve everything and also we're going to cover every thing, so definitely if you hear this and we don't hot your favorite story, please angrily hit us up on Twitter, because we will intend to be as exhaustive as possible in an hour-to-90 minute a week podcast or whatever we're going to cover everything we're going to make it -

Chris: Here’s who’s going to solve it all, is a guy who's read the Bible a lot and his friend The College Dropout.

Benito: Yeah man we're going to make Tertullian look like a straight fool. We’re going to be like “get out of here, Augustine of Hippo with your mind trash, we're going to come in here and we're going to solve it all once a week on Apple podcast. Support our Patreon.” 

Chris: Which we do not have. But if we do have one, we are going to call it a collection plate-reon. 

Benito: And let me say, obviously I was being sarcastic, there's no way we're going to cover everything, and if we do miss your favorite story, why don’t you write it on the outside of an offering envelope, slip it in the old plate, and then maybe we'll think about getting to it and addressing your concerns. 

Chris: You know, I believe this I believe this book directly speaks against that kind of thing

Benito: You're exactly right. Anyway, in terms of dating this book, when is it come out, there's a range. We know the earliest possible date for it is around 65 to 67 CE. Why do we know that? Well, because it describes things that happened in those years, right, like the bit with Paul at the end, and we know that was happening around the mid-60s, because when it mentions actual, like, historical figures that we can verify those things. We know obviously if it's describing an action, it has to have come out after that. The absolute earliest we’re looking at his mid-60s CE, however many scholars think that the tone represents kind of a maturity of thought that would have required time to think about this for a little bit and then reflect on the early church history and so most modern mainstream scholars are going to date of the book of Acts somewhere between the 80s and the 90s CE. Only 90s kids remember Simon Magus. Another way that we can create a range for books is we look at the actions. We can say obviously it came out after the things it is describing. We can look and see when do other people start talking about the book, when do we find another text that refers to this book, and we know that puts a floor on that right, it obviously came out before someone else was talking about it in their book, and it helps create a range. In this case were looking at probably 80s or 90s CE so not too far afield from you know, the life of Jesus and that kind of stuff. I should say, like the rest of the New Testament, this book was written in Greek, a style of Greek known as koine Greek which would have been common throughout the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which would’ve included Judea, which is where all these characters and people are from. 

Chris: So when I compared the book of Acts to the movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, you're saying it was way better a comparison than I thought it was. Because Luke’s here, it's about 40 years after the original, the good guys have won, but uh-oh things are getting a little hairy again.

Benito: It was a very apt comparison and the Holy Spirit is way more like The Force than you could ever imagine.

Chris: I think that's the other thing that surprised me. So let’s get into the events because we’ve got the little intro, what’s up fam it’s ya boy Luke here to tell you all the story of how my life got flipped turned upside down and I went to Rome with Peter

Benito: With Paul

Chris: With Paul. Look, it’s tough. If you missed the zero episode, the entire reason that we’re doing this is that I could name more Supreme Court Justices that I can Apostles. 

Benito: You could probably also name more members of The Supremes than you could Apostles, speaking of that. 

Chris: Fortunately, we get a run-down right up front. We get a dramatis personae real quick. So here’s our boys: we got Peter “The Rock”. You called him Simon “The Rock” Peter, which I liked a lot. We’ve got John - now is that John the Evangelist?

Benito: Arguably, traditionally it is, yeah

Chris: We’ve got James

Benito: They’re brothers, brothers of thunder they're called, James and John 
Chris: Wait, is that not James, brother of Jesus? 

Benito: No, we're going to get back to that! This is James the brother of John. James the Great, as he is called. Yea so Peter James and John are like in the gospels are the three big ones, they’re the big three, right, that's why they're listed first.

Chris: Okay so we've got those three, Andrew which is Peter’s brother, Philip, Thomas, oh he’s the one that doubts I know him. Now is that Thomas of the infancy gospels? Allegedly?

Benito: Allegedly, yeah 

Chris: We've got Bartholomew. Is there anything I need to know about him going forward? 

Benito: Not really. No he's not a major player. 

Chris: We got Matthew -  

Benito: Right, Matthew. This is Matthew the Evangelist, allegedly.

Chris: Right first guy in the [i missed this :c] 

Benito: Also known as Levi, that’s his other name.

Chris: We’ve got James the son of Alphaeus 

Benito: Right he's known as James the Less, right, to compare with James the Great, which is a really sucky nickname to get, but it’s really just to contrast the importance of their roles in the gospels. There's a lot of questions about James the son of Alphaeus and we’ll come back to him.

Chris: Alright last two, we’ve got Simon the Zealot, who I guess was just was really into it. 

Benito: The Zealots were a religious sect/political party at the time, so it’s not just that he’s really into it, it’s a specific thing.

Chris: And our last guy, the unfortunately-named Judas, son of James. 

Benito: And this is not Judas Iscariot. This is Judas Thaddeus, as he’s known, and so he is frequently known as Saint Jude. You know Saint Jude Children's Hospital? That's this guy. Obviously that’s 11, because we're missing Judas Iscariot at this point.

Chris: And we should also say, they are also hanging out with Mary, who is not in the title page lineup but she is mentioned continually being there, united in prayer. But yes so we have 11 of these boys, because the twelfth, as you may have heard, is being eaten by Satan, according to Dante Alighieri. 

Benito: Yea, getting chewed up your boy 

Chris: So what happened to him, according to Acts 1:15? 

Benito: Yeah according to Acts, your boy blew up. He blew up. 

Chris: If you’re familiar with the Bible story, it’s usually depicted as Judas committing suicide by hanging himself. That’s what’s in your Jesus Christ Superstars. 

Benito: It’s in Matthew 27:5. Matthew 27:5 says “He threw the silver into the sanctuary, departed, and then he went and hanged himself. That’s the gospel version. 

Chris: Acts book 1 chapters 8 and 19 say “Now this man acquired a field with his unrighteous wages. He fell head first and burst open in the middle and all his inside spilled out. This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem so that in their own language the field is called Hakeldama, that is, field of blood.” What do you like better, Judas going and being like, wracked with guilt and hanging himself, or Judas exploding and all the blood of his body shooting out like it's Evil Dead 2? 

Benito: Yeah man, obviously that’s a rhetorical question you don't need to answer that, we came out the gate hot. We know this book is something special because it starts with a man exploding and his blood spraying all across the field.

Chris: This is the first page in my copy of the Bible, which is an HCSB, so you can read along in the Holman Christian Standard Bible, or you know, I’m guessing this is in most Bibles. Page one is “Hey, we're back, what's up everybody, we're back here’s who I'm hanging out with, also remember that dude? He exploded. And all the blood came out of his body, all the blood and guts.” It’s literally blood and guts on page one. That's the first page. Here’s what’s wild though, the HCSB has little chapter headings so you know what's going on in each little section. Those are not in every Bible. Like I don't believe that traditionally they’re in the the King James version.

Benito: It depends on the edition. 

Chris: But the little headline for the section where Judas explodes is “Matthias was chosen”. Because this book is like “hey, this guy exploded and now everybody calls that place the field of blood”, which is a dope name, by the way. Let’s get into some parliamentary procedure, because we want to get some new Apostles in here. And then they devote the next couple pages to being like “well we gotta pray about it, we gotta have elections, you got to see who's nominated” and they wind up on Matthias [audio clip: “...and Steven!” from Steven Universe]. So yea. Those are our guys, just like “hey, Matthias and Stephen are here”. 
Benito: Yeah, I mean Stephen is not one of the12, not one of the big 12 but he is among the new early church disciples. But yeah that's pretty much at the end there and they called this section “Matthias was chosen” which really like buried the lede. If this were my edition of the Bible, that header would one hundo P “Judas explodes”. Right? That’s the header.

Chris: And I feel like this is another example of you knowing me and when I'm like “I want to read the Bible, and brush up and learn some things” you're like “start here, a dude explodes”. We get a lot of parliamentary procedure. This is what’s weird about the early part of the book of Acts. Dude explodes, we had an election, and then, then it goes back to oh by the way Peter can do miracles. I was very surprised about that, I was under the impression, and I don't know if this is a thing from being raised Protestant, that like we are not (“we” as in “Protestants”, which I don't really consider myself anymore but it's how I was raised) Protestants do not generally concern themselves with saints. There are a few sects of Protestantism, I believe, the Episcopalian church, the Anglican Church still recognize saints but Southern Baptist sure doesn’t.

Benito: No absolutely not. Many Protestant denominations, like, their idea is the sainthood of all believers. The idea is that if you become a Christian, you're a saint, you did it, good job, and there's no difference between you (you know not “you” you but you know what I mean) and say Saint Christopher, right, except that he's also a werewolf. But you know whatever.

Chris: He got kicked out too, I know that. Because I have a vested interest in knowing that. He got kicked out and then reinstated.

Benito: Because they were like, “Wait, we gave a sainthood to a werewolf? That’s messed up.” Anyway. But their idea is there's no significant difference between you two, and the veneration of saints, the idea that you would pray to a saint is a little redolent of idolatry for many Evangelical denominations. They don't like the idea of praying to someone who's not God, basically. 

Chris: I’d grown up kind of assuming, you hear about the Jesus miracles, right, like you hear about the saint’s stories but those are obviously much later. I think if you are not raised Catholic, they are presented to you is kind of like do this, they are presented to you almost like fairy tales. Honestly, like a dude fights a dragon. 

Benito: In more than one. In way more than one story.

Chris: A dude fights the last dragon. That’s right, Taimak shows up in Saint George’s story. But I had always kind of assumed, and I don't know if this is just me assuming it or if this is something that was taught to me, that miracles like resurrecting the dead, healing the sick, were the provenance of Jesus. He was the guy who can do it. That's why, you know, faith healing is bad, Jesus had that power. It’s one of the reasons you know he's the son of God. Roll up into Acts and Pentecostal rolls around and then Peter’s like, “B T dubs, I can heal the sick, I can resurrect the dead”, which is kind of a big one that’s just really kind of like, by the way somebody fell off a building and died, and Peter was like “hey, it's okay, wake up”, and she did.
 
Benito: We also see, later we see Paul resurrecting someone from the dead as well, they each get to do one. And he’s not even a founder. But I mean we do see in the gospels some of the Apostles having the ability to heal the sick and that kind of stuff, but their powers definitely get amped up following Pentecost. And I feel like we should probably talk about what is Pentecost, what does that mean, why is it important. Pentecost from a Greek word that means “50th” because it's the 50th day after Passover. Within the context of the Apostles, they would have been looking at 50 days after Passover. It's 7 weeks and now Christian Pentecost is now the seventh Sunday after Easter, so that comes 49 but in ancient times they counted inclusively, so you count including the day that you're on. So it would equal 50. Anyway. But within Jewish tradition, Pentecost is celebrated as traditionally that the law was given, like Moses coming down and such. So 50 days after Passover. I feel like, we, in America, it's not as big a thing, maybe I'm wrong about that. Or maybe within Evangelical churches, it’s not as big a thing, I know in Europe they celebrate it more. In England it’s also known as Whitsunday,  “white Sunday”, it's the last day of the Easter season if you're in a church that recognizes liturgical seasons, right, like the Easter season obviously starts with Easter and would end 52 days later at Pentecost. Also Pentecost, relevant to your interests, would have been the day on which King Arthur gathered the round table and gave them all a quest. Most big stories of the round table start at Pentecost.

Chris: Not Sir Galwain though, that’s Christmas.

Benito: Yeah, Pentecost and Christmas were the big  Christian holidays were they would assemble and discuss their feats, and then usually get some kind of quest.

Chris: Well that makes sense, if it’s 50 days after Passover, it’s like an every six months sort of thing. You know check in.

Benito: But so yea Pentecost becomes kind of a big deal here because it's the day on which the Holy Spirit descends on the Apostles, and that’s really why. That's when you get the big transition from the very afraid and sometimes goofy and incompetent Apostles of the gospels, right, like when you think of Peter like we were first starting, you just assumed Peter was always going to be like the lovable doofus, right, who's always like hecking up, because that's kind of what you get in the gospels right like he's like “hey Jesus I’m gonna walk on water too, woooahh I fell”, or “I’m gonna deny you three times” or you know whatever. But yeah like, at this point the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of flame, appears above their heads, descends upon them, gives them superpowers, and also the power of super competency. Which they were lacking before. They're not hiding anymore, and in fact this is the point at which they begin to be fearlessly killed. Right, like we start to see the apostles getting killed off. Not all in here, but this is where it starts, because they stop being afraid. They're no longer huddling in the house, they are, they're going out.
Chris: Yeah I know at least two of those dudes are opening crawl were [killed] pretty famously, to the point where we still refer to things as St Peters crosses and St Andrew's crosses.

Benito: Of course the St Peter's cross is not within the Bible, but we're going to get to that. But yeah, so tongues of flame. You can see it if you ever see a Methodist Church, if they're part of the United Methodists, their logo on their sign is going to be a cross with a tongue of flame next to it. It’s not like a Klan thing, it’s not a burning cross, it’s the tongues of flame that represent the Holy Spirit, right. And then of course the Pentecostal church is so-called because their denomination focuses on connection through the Holy Spirit and the movement of the Holy Spirit within people. And it makes you shake on the floor, or whatever. So yea, Pentecost, a bigger deal for some denominations than others, I guess is what I'm getting at. But it's a very significant day for the history of the apostles. 

Chris: So they get the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit returns for them to hang out, I guess, in there. Like it is very much presented like the Force. Like they can use it for things.

Benito: Yeah, it's not just the thing where every Christian suddenly has it and can do all these things, because we see some of the other believers trying to do it. It is specifically the apostles and then their closest followers who actually have powers associated with the Holy Spirit.

Chris: So the first thing they decide to use the Holy Spirit is to create communism. It says, again this is the HCSB translation, Acts 4:34-35 “For there was not a needy person among them, because all those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles’ feet. This was then distributed for each person’s basic needs.” That's literally the definition of communism. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. 

Benito: Yea and it follows what Jesus says in the gospel. Jesus says “Go sell your stuff, give the money to the poor, you don't need anything, leave it, follow me, your needs will be taken care of. You don't need to own property.” Like that’s legit, that’s the early church. The point where, we see here in chapter 5 the story of Ananais and Saphira. 

Chris: I was excited about this story. It's pretty dope. 

Benito: We got the story, we got this guy Ananais and his wife Saphira. They are followers, they are members of the church. They have a piece of property, they sell it, and as it says, he kept back part of the proceeds with his wife's knowledge and brought a portion of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet. You know, he goes about it halfway, right. I'm going to partially do what you said, I’m going to be a partial communist, gonna keep a few things in my own pocket cuz, you know, bootstraps, et cetera. And then Peter’s like “Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? And keep back part of the proceeds from the field?” And he dies. 

Chris: He doesn’t die, he is struck dead by the Holy Spirit. 
Benito: Yeah, he heard these words he dropped dead, and a great fear came on all who heard. Young men got up, wrapped his body, carried him out, and buried him. 

Chris: And we know that it wasn't just like, oh he was caught in a lie, had a heart attack and dropped because then Saphira shows up and Peter’s like, “Hey, was this all the money from the sale of your land?” And she was like “yeah pretty sure”, and he's like “well, I’m pretty sure the Holy Ghost is gonna strike you dead”. Which happens.

Benito: It happens. Yeah. It is wild to read that, right, like God is literally murdering people for not being sufficiently socialist, and look at how far we’ve come. Look how far we've come. 

Chris: Yeah dude, that is shocking. It was very surprising to me to find out. First of all, I feel like if the pope could call down the Holy Spirit, because Peter’s the first pope. Right. If the pope could call down the Holy Spirit, like strike down enemies of the church, I feel like the history of Western Civilization takes a dramatic turn. 

Benito: Yeah there's definitely some popes in the Middle Ages, who, if they had that power to kill people with mind bullets, they would have. For sure. Like literally you have - 

Chris: Certainly an Avignon. 

Benito: I was going to say, popes and anti-popes. That would have been wild. Magic popes vs. anti-popes flying around, zapping each other with tongues of flame. European History AP. Take me away. 

Chris: And I feel like we would have heard about that. 

Benito: Yeah, I feel like we would have. 

Chris: So Peter’s full communism. Like full on sell your land, let's get going comrades. Apostles of the world unite. And everybody's pretty into this. Stephen’s pretty into it. So into it, that he gets stoned.
