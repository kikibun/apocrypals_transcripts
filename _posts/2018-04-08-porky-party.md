title: 1 Porky Party (The Book of Acts)
---

Chris: “Look you scoffers, marvel and vanish away because I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will never believe, even if someone were to explain it to you.” Acts 13:41
Hello friends and neighbors and welcome to Apocrypals. It’s the podcast where two non-believers read through the bible but we’re not….you know...a-holes about it. My name is Chris Sims and with me as always is the other set of footprints, Benito Cereno. Benito how are you today?

Benito: Chris I’m excellent, how're you this very good Holy Week?

Chris: I’m very excited because this is our first episode of Apocrypals and I am very much looking forward to talking about the book of Acts, which is pretty amazing.

Benito: It is pretty good, I feel like we made a good choice for our first book, but I did want to ask - do you know what today is, the day that we're recording here during Holy Week? Do you know what today’s name is?

Chris: Let’s see, it’s not Ash Wednesday because that already happened

Benito: That’s the one at the beginning of Lent, yea
 
Chris: And it’s not Palm Sunday

Benito: That was this past Sunday

Chris: Yea and it’s not Good Friday because it’s Wednesday, so no what is today?

Benito: Today is called Spy Wednesday. It’s Spy Wednesday.

Chris: I’m sorry?

Benito: It’s Spy Wednesday. S-P-Y “spy” and it is traditionally the day on which Judas Iscariot turns Jesus over to the Romans, so the word “spy” in this case indicates an ambush or a betrayal. So today’s Spy Wednesday. Tomorrow - do you know what tomorrow is called?

Chris: Tomorrow is Thursday

Benito: Yep

Chris: So that would be...is it Maundy Thursday?

Benito: It is Maundy Thursday, which is the perfect church-sanctioned day to go get your pedi, is tomorrow because it’s the day you celebrate Jesus washing his disciples’ feet, so go get your pedi on tomorrow.
Chris: Then we have Good Friday and Bad Saturday

Benito: Bad Saturday. Usually Holy Saturday, but yea Bad Saturday. Huddle House Saturday, we used to call it in my teens, because it was the day in which all the apostles went and huddled in a house because they were afraid because Jesus was dead and they didn’t know what was going to happen.

Chris: I am pretty sure from reading the menu at the Huddle House restaurant which is like a third rate Waffle House that that is not the inspiration for the name “Huddle House”.

Benito: No i think not. “Here take this waffle that is given unto you. Take and eat all of it.” No I don’t think so.

Chris: I don’t need a special occasion to take all the waffle and eat of it. And then of course there's Easter Sunday which is not today, and it’s probably not today when you’re listening to this, but it is time for us to talk about the Bible a little bit. And this and it’s good that you bing all this up, because today as we mentioned we are talking about the book of Acts, which takes place immediately after Easter Sunday.

Benito: Uh pretty much it’s in the aftermath of that, it’s within a month of Easter, yea

Chris: Now if you want to hear about why we chose the book of Acts we do go through it in detail on our zero episode where we also talk about our history with the church and religion in general and we kind of lay out our plan and talk about the version of the Bible we’re using but for anyone who just skipped ahead and just wanted to get to the good good Bible discussion this book study that we’re doing Benito this was your choice. Why did you choose to start us off with the book of Acts instead of a Genesis or even a Matthew?

Benito: When we first started this I didn’t realize we were going to be doing this as a podcast, but uh i picked this one because - 

Chris: Don’t put that on me, this was your idea - 

Benito: It was my idea and the podcast was also my idea, that’s true, but it was one of those things where once we got into it I was like “oh this is a podcast right this is a podcast” but I picked it because I thought we should start with the New Testament, it’s just a little bit more familiar, a little bit easier to read, also most of the New Testament books are shorter than many Old Testament books, it would feature a cast of characters you would mostly be familiar with but also like I said it’s got action right there in the title, we've got not one but two evil wizards and there are number of other things that I thought would appeal to your particular sensibilities, so I thought this would be good a one to start with even though it is an explicit sequel which is maybe a little bit weird for the very first thing to start with part two but we did it.

Chris: Odds are pretty good that if you are listening to a podcast about the Bible you’re at least passingly familiar with the story of Jesus Christ and look you probably know what happens on Good Friday, you probably know what happens on Easter Sunday, those are the big ones

Benito: Those are the big ones yea

Chris: Probably know what happens on Christmas. Not a lot between those honestly there's some stuff there's combing the seas there's walking on water there's feeding the masses, he does all that

Benito: Yep and you know we will get here eventually we'll get to read four traditional versions of that and then multiple ones for people who are like “why doesn’t anyone talk about what he did when he was a toddler” we can get to those too but we’ll have plenty of time to talk about Jesus

Chris: Oh, let me introduce you to Thomas

Benito: Indeed but for now I thought we would start with these guys 

Chris: Right so let's talk about Acts. Let’s get into the book of Acts. This was a surprising one for me because you know most people who have a more passing familiarity with the Bible and I‘m including myself in this you know of feel like oh right you know Jesus is crucified, resurrected from the dead, ascends to heaven, and the rest of the New Testament is just letters, it's epistilary books, it’s Romans, it’s Corinthians, it’s all that and then you get to Revelations which gets wild. I didn’t realize there was going to be a lot of activity in the post-Jesus pre-letters section of the Bible that would also involve other people doing miracles. That was the most surprising things about Acts for me.

Benito: Yea alright I mean yea it’s the transition book. It’s the transition from well Jesus is gone from the earth physically, what happens now? Right? And also you know it has its own thesis to it, right, there's why’s the book of Acts written? Because its stands for question, and that question is, if Christianity is a Jewish religion in origin why’re most of Christians Gentiles? That’s the question that this book basically sets out to answer, like it’s an origin story for why most Christians are not actually Jewish, and you can see that in this structure of the book where all the action starts centered in Jerusalem and then it kind of spirals outward. You go from Jerusalem to Sumeria to Syria out into Asia Minor and then into Europe and then finally the book ends with the most influential Christian at then time literally sitting in the seat of the pagan empire, continuing his mission without hindrance right like that’s the end of the book. So you see the growth that literally follows a pattern like if you look at a map you can see the way that it’s like concentric circle spreading outward and that's kind of what the book is about. So yea like I said this book is an explicit sequel. One way we know that is because it starts it literally starts with “I wrote the first narrative Theophilus about all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day he was taken up, after He had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen.” So it literally stars with him saying remember what I did in my first book. And one way that we know that - 

Chris: It’s like it plays under the credits, it’s like a recap

Benito: Previously in “The Bible” yea so this is one way that we know that the author of the book of Acts is the same guy as the author of the gospel according to Luke, right

Chris: Wait wait wait question - so why is it Luke and not Matthew, err, John, because John is the last one, John is the one that comes immediately before

Benito: John is the last one, I don’t exactly know why the gospels get ordered the way that they are. It’s not chronological, Mark is the earliest of the gospels for sure Matthew and Luke would have been roughly contemporary, John would have been the latest but we know Luke and Acts are the same author through this like textual analysis we can see they use the same kind of vocabulary, ans phraseology that kind of stuff but they're both addressed to this guy Theophilus right, they’re both written, basically as not quite a letter, but they're written to this guy. They say “Hey Theophilus here's a book I wrote for you.” Who is Theophilus? We do not know. I know Chris you don’t speak Greek but you might be able to put it together

Chris: Oh I can guess this one: “theo” meaning “religion”

Benito: Or “god”

Chris: And “philius” meaning “a lover of”

Benito: Exactly

Chris: So is Theophilus a specific person or is he just saying “hey fans this is, you know i’m back, back once again”

Benito: You have literally hit on a question that people have been arguing for like two thousand years. The question is, is Theophilus a real person, is it a nickname, is it a code name, is it a name for like “what’s up squad fam” yeah basically is that what's going on here at the beginning? We don’t know yeah it just means a lover of god, and it could have and it could have been a real person's name that is lost to history, it could be a code name because he's a secret Christian, it could be a nickname, we don't know, but it is one of those things that ties the two books together. 

Chris: So it’s either “what's up squad” or it's like when Bruno Mars tells Julio to get the stretch. 

Benito: Yes, it’s like that.

Chris: It’s a character we don’t know a lot about.

Benito: Exactly, exactly. A character that we otherwise know nothing about. As a result both of these books since very very early days have been attributed to Luke. And the question is who is Luke? He’s a name that we see appear a couple of times throughout Paul's letters. For example, Colossians 4:14 refers to Luke the dearly loved physician, which is the only place we learn Luke’s day job, right, he's not an Evangelist by day, he’s a physician. He’s again in 2 Timothy 4:11 where he says only Luke is with me, this is Paul talking, bring Mark with you which is believed to be the Mark of Mark the Evangelist, and then in the book of Philemon one you don't hear a lot about, verse 24 which doesn't even have chapters it’s so short, he says “Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers”. So he's mentioned a couple times in Paul's letter, so he refers to them, yeah so we see Luke in a couple of those places. So the question is, why do we assume that these books are written by a guy that was friends with Paul? I don’t know if you noticed this when you were reading Chris, there are five different sections in the book of Acts where it suddenly just, like, low-key slips into first-person, where there's places where it's like “and then we sailed here” “and then we went here” “and then we were put in prison” and you know that kind of stuff. There’s five sections where that happens.

Chris: I did not 

Benito: Yeah well those first person passages are what has led people to assume that these books must be more or less first-person accounts, or at least you know worst case second hand accounts, of things that happened to a friend and companion of Paul. Luke becomes the good candidate because as a physician he would have been literate, for one thing, which was not a guarantee at that time. Also Luke has a Greco-Roman name, right, the name “Luke” is derived ultimately from the Latin name Lucius. The fact that he has a Greco-Roman name is a good sign because the Book of Luke and also the book of Acts are largely concerned with and targeted towards Gentile audiences, and his phraseology, his terminology, those kind of things within the text point to the idea that this is a Greek guy, not a Jewish guy, who's writing these things.

Chris: Here’s my question. Why wouldn't it be Paul? Is it because there’s discussion of Paul in this one? And the reason I ask is this - not to get too far afield right here at the beginning before we’ve even gotten past chapter 1 verse 1 of this book, but we know in the Apocryphal acts where the homie Simon Magus comes back that Peter and Paul in that book are the ones who go see Nero and have an encounter with Simon Magus, so it is not mentioned, I believe, that Paul goes with Peter on the boat in this one, so it seems like he would be a likely candidate for the companion.

Benito: Yeah, uh, no

Chris: So that’s a flat no
Benito: Yeah the acts of Peter and Paul which we’ll get to later are considerably later than this right - 

Chris: I mean yea I’m not surprised

Benito: I mean one of the reasons that they're apocryphal is that they were written like a full three centuries after this, probably like around the time that canon was being established basically. 

Chris: I don't know what you want to do with this podcast but I'm planning on solving everything that has been asked for sure 

Benito: Yeah I feel like that's a good thing we should set up front. We should say “hey guys I know everyone's been talking about this for two thousand years or more, if we include the Hebrew scriptures we're going back four thousand years maybe, suddenly we're going to solve everything and also we're going to cover every thing, so definitely if you hear this and we don't hot your favorite story, please angrily hit us up on Twitter, because we will intend to be as exhaustive as possible in an hour-to-90 minute a week podcast or whatever we're going to cover everything we're going to make it -

Chris: Here’s who’s going to solve it all, is a guy who's read the Bible a lot and his friend The College Dropout.

Benito: Yeah man we're going to make Tertullian look like a straight fool. We’re going to be like “get out of here, Augustine of Hippo with your mind trash, we're going to come in here and we're going to solve it all once a week on Apple podcast. Support our Patreon.” 

Chris: Which we do not have. But if we do have one, we are going to call it a collection plate-reon. 

Benito: And let me say, obviously I was being sarcastic, there's no way we're going to cover everything, and if we do miss your favorite story, why don’t you write it on the outside of an offering envelope, slip it in the old plate, and then maybe we'll think about getting to it and addressing your concerns. 

Chris: You know, I believe this I believe this book directly speaks against that kind of thing

Benito: You're exactly right. Anyway, in terms of dating this book, when is it come out, there's a range. We know the earliest possible date for it is around 65 to 67 CE. Why do we know that? Well, because it describes things that happened in those years, right, like the bit with Paul at the end, and we know that was happening around the mid-60s, because when it mentions actual, like, historical figures that we can verify those things. We know obviously if it's describing an action, it has to have come out after that. The absolute earliest we’re looking at his mid-60s CE, however many scholars think that the tone represents kind of a maturity of thought that would have required time to think about this for a little bit and then reflect on the early church history and so most modern mainstream scholars are going to date of the book of Acts somewhere between the 80s and the 90s CE. Only 90s kids remember Simon Magus. Another way that we can create a range for books is we look at the actions. We can say obviously it came out after the things it is describing. We can look and see when do other people start talking about the book, when do we find another text that refers to this book, and we know that puts a floor on that right, it obviously came out before someone else was talking about it in their book, and it helps create a range. In this case were looking at probably 80s or 90s CE so not too far afield from you know, the life of Jesus and that kind of stuff. I should say, like the rest of the New Testament, this book was written in Greek, a style of Greek known as koine Greek which would have been common throughout the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which would’ve included Judea, which is where all these characters and people are from. 

Chris: So when I compared the book of Acts to the movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, you're saying it was way better a comparison than I thought it was. Because Luke’s here, it's about 40 years after the original, the good guys have won, but uh-oh things are getting a little hairy again.

Benito: It was a very apt comparison and the Holy Spirit is way more like The Force than you could ever imagine.

Chris: I think that's the other thing that surprised me. So let’s get into the events because we’ve got the little intro, what’s up fam it’s ya boy Luke here to tell you all the story of how my life got flipped turned upside down and I went to Rome with Peter

Benito: With Paul

Chris: With Paul. Look, it’s tough. If you missed the zero episode, the entire reason that we’re doing this is that I could name more Supreme Court Justices that I can Apostles. 

Benito: You could probably also name more members of The Supremes than you could Apostles, speaking of that. 

Chris: Fortunately, we get a run-down right up front. We get a dramatis personae real quick. So here’s our boys: we got Peter “The Rock”. You called him Simon “The Rock” Peter, which I liked a lot. We’ve got John - now is that John the Evangelist?

Benito: Arguably, traditionally it is, yeah

Chris: We’ve got James

Benito: They’re brothers, brothers of thunder they're called, James and John 
Chris: Wait, is that not James, brother of Jesus? 

Benito: No, we're going to get back to that! This is James the brother of John. James the Great, as he is called. Yea so Peter James and John are like in the gospels are the three big ones, they’re the big three, right, that's why they're listed first.

Chris: Okay so we've got those three, Andrew which is Peter’s brother, Philip, Thomas, oh he’s the one that doubts I know him. Now is that Thomas of the infancy gospels? Allegedly?

Benito: Allegedly, yeah 

Chris: We've got Bartholomew. Is there anything I need to know about him going forward? 

Benito: Not really. No he's not a major player. 

Chris: We got Matthew -  

Benito: Right, Matthew. This is Matthew the Evangelist, allegedly.

Chris: Right first guy in the [i missed this :c] 

Benito: Also known as Levi, that’s his other name.

Chris: We’ve got James the son of Alphaeus 

Benito: Right he's known as James the Less, right, to compare with James the Great, which is a really sucky nickname to get, but it’s really just to contrast the importance of their roles in the gospels. There's a lot of questions about James the son of Alphaeus and we’ll come back to him.

Chris: Alright last two, we’ve got Simon the Zealot, who I guess was just was really into it. 

Benito: The Zealots were a religious sect/political party at the time, so it’s not just that he’s really into it, it’s a specific thing.

Chris: And our last guy, the unfortunately-named Judas, son of James. 

Benito: And this is not Judas Iscariot. This is Judas Thaddeus, as he’s known, and so he is frequently known as Saint Jude. You know Saint Jude Children's Hospital? That's this guy. Obviously that’s 11, because we're missing Judas Iscariot at this point.

Chris: And we should also say, they are also hanging out with Mary, who is not in the title page lineup but she is mentioned continually being there, united in prayer. But yes so we have 11 of these boys, because the twelfth, as you may have heard, is being eaten by Satan, according to Dante Alighieri. 

Benito: Yea, getting chewed up your boy 

Chris: So what happened to him, according to Acts 1:15? 

Benito: Yeah according to Acts, your boy blew up. He blew up. 

Chris: If you’re familiar with the Bible story, it’s usually depicted as Judas committing suicide by hanging himself. That’s what’s in your Jesus Christ Superstars. 

Benito: It’s in Matthew 27:5. Matthew 27:5 says “He threw the silver into the sanctuary, departed, and then he went and hanged himself. That’s the gospel version. 

Chris: Acts book 1 chapters 8 and 19 say “Now this man acquired a field with his unrighteous wages. He fell head first and burst open in the middle and all his inside spilled out. This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem so that in their own language the field is called Hakeldama, that is, field of blood.” What do you like better, Judas going and being like, wracked with guilt and hanging himself, or Judas exploding and all the blood of his body shooting out like it's Evil Dead 2? 

Benito: Yeah man, obviously that’s a rhetorical question you don't need to answer that, we came out the gate hot. We know this book is something special because it starts with a man exploding and his blood spraying all across the field.

Chris: This is the first page in my copy of the Bible, which is an HCSB, so you can read along in the Holman Christian Standard Bible, or you know, I’m guessing this is in most Bibles. Page one is “Hey, we're back, what's up everybody, we're back here’s who I'm hanging out with, also remember that dude? He exploded. And all the blood came out of his body, all the blood and guts.” It’s literally blood and guts on page one. That's the first page. Here’s what’s wild though, the HCSB has little chapter headings so you know what's going on in each little section. Those are not in every Bible. Like I don't believe that traditionally they’re in the the King James version.

Benito: It depends on the edition. 

Chris: But the little headline for the section where Judas explodes is “Matthias was chosen”. Because this book is like “hey, this guy exploded and now everybody calls that place the field of blood”, which is a dope name, by the way. Let’s get into some parliamentary procedure, because we want to get some new Apostles in here. And then they devote the next couple pages to being like “well we gotta pray about it, we gotta have elections, you got to see who's nominated” and they wind up on Matthias [audio clip: “...and Steven!” from Steven Universe]. So yea. Those are our guys, just like “hey, Matthias and Stephen are here”. 
Benito: Yeah, I mean Stephen is not one of the12, not one of the big 12 but he is among the new early church disciples. But yeah that's pretty much at the end there and they called this section “Matthias was chosen” which really like buried the lede. If this were my edition of the Bible, that header would one hundo P “Judas explodes”. Right? That’s the header.

Chris: And I feel like this is another example of you knowing me and when I'm like “I want to read the Bible, and brush up and learn some things” you're like “start here, a dude explodes”. We get a lot of parliamentary procedure. This is what’s weird about the early part of the book of Acts. Dude explodes, we had an election, and then, then it goes back to oh by the way Peter can do miracles. I was very surprised about that, I was under the impression, and I don't know if this is a thing from being raised Protestant, that like we are not (“we” as in “Protestants”, which I don't really consider myself anymore but it's how I was raised) Protestants do not generally concern themselves with saints. There are a few sects of Protestantism, I believe, the Episcopalian church, the Anglican Church still recognize saints but Southern Baptist sure doesn’t.

Benito: No absolutely not. Many Protestant denominations, like, their idea is the sainthood of all believers. The idea is that if you become a Christian, you're a saint, you did it, good job, and there's no difference between you (you know not “you” you but you know what I mean) and say Saint Christopher, right, except that he's also a werewolf. But you know whatever.

Chris: He got kicked out too, I know that. Because I have a vested interest in knowing that. He got kicked out and then reinstated.

Benito: Because they were like, “Wait, we gave a sainthood to a werewolf? That’s messed up.” Anyway. But their idea is there's no significant difference between you two, and the veneration of saints, the idea that you would pray to a saint is a little redolent of idolatry for many Evangelical denominations. They don't like the idea of praying to someone who's not God, basically. 

Chris: I’d grown up kind of assuming, you hear about the Jesus miracles, right, like you hear about the saint’s stories but those are obviously much later. I think if you are not raised Catholic, they are presented to you is kind of like do this, they are presented to you almost like fairy tales. Honestly, like a dude fights a dragon. 

Benito: In more than one. In way more than one story.

Chris: A dude fights the last dragon. That’s right, Taimak shows up in Saint George’s story. But I had always kind of assumed, and I don't know if this is just me assuming it or if this is something that was taught to me, that miracles like resurrecting the dead, healing the sick, were the provenance of Jesus. He was the guy who can do it. That's why, you know, faith healing is bad, Jesus had that power. It’s one of the reasons you know he's the son of God. Roll up into Acts and Pentecostal rolls around and then Peter’s like, “B T dubs, I can heal the sick, I can resurrect the dead”, which is kind of a big one that’s just really kind of like, by the way somebody fell off a building and died, and Peter was like “hey, it's okay, wake up”, and she did.
 
Benito: We also see, later we see Paul resurrecting someone from the dead as well, they each get to do one. And he’s not even a founder. But I mean we do see in the gospels some of the Apostles having the ability to heal the sick and that kind of stuff, but their powers definitely get amped up following Pentecost. And I feel like we should probably talk about what is Pentecost, what does that mean, why is it important. Pentecost from a Greek word that means “50th” because it's the 50th day after Passover. Within the context of the Apostles, they would have been looking at 50 days after Passover. It's 7 weeks and now Christian Pentecost is now the seventh Sunday after Easter, so that comes 49 but in ancient times they counted inclusively, so you count including the day that you're on. So it would equal 50. Anyway. But within Jewish tradition, Pentecost is celebrated as traditionally that the law was given, like Moses coming down and such. So 50 days after Passover. I feel like, we, in America, it's not as big a thing, maybe I'm wrong about that. Or maybe within Evangelical churches, it’s not as big a thing, I know in Europe they celebrate it more. In England it’s also known as Whitsunday,  “white Sunday”, it's the last day of the Easter season if you're in a church that recognizes liturgical seasons, right, like the Easter season obviously starts with Easter and would end 52 days later at Pentecost. Also Pentecost, relevant to your interests, would have been the day on which King Arthur gathered the round table and gave them all a quest. Most big stories of the round table start at Pentecost.

Chris: Not Sir Galwain though, that’s Christmas.

Benito: Yeah, Pentecost and Christmas were the big  Christian holidays were they would assemble and discuss their feats, and then usually get some kind of quest.

Chris: Well that makes sense, if it’s 50 days after Passover, it’s like an every six months sort of thing. You know check in.

Benito: But so yea Pentecost becomes kind of a big deal here because it's the day on which the Holy Spirit descends on the Apostles, and that’s really why. That's when you get the big transition from the very afraid and sometimes goofy and incompetent Apostles of the gospels, right, like when you think of Peter like we were first starting, you just assumed Peter was always going to be like the lovable doofus, right, who's always like hecking up, because that's kind of what you get in the gospels right like he's like “hey Jesus I’m gonna walk on water too, woooahh I fell”, or “I’m gonna deny you three times” or you know whatever. But yeah like, at this point the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of flame, appears above their heads, descends upon them, gives them superpowers, and also the power of super competency. Which they were lacking before. They're not hiding anymore, and in fact this is the point at which they begin to be fearlessly killed. Right, like we start to see the apostles getting killed off. Not all in here, but this is where it starts, because they stop being afraid. They're no longer huddling in the house, they are, they're going out.
Chris: Yeah I know at least two of those dudes are opening crawl were [killed] pretty famously, to the point where we still refer to things as St Peters crosses and St Andrew's crosses.

Benito: Of course the St Peter's cross is not within the Bible, but we're going to get to that. But yeah, so tongues of flame. You can see it if you ever see a Methodist Church, if they're part of the United Methodists, their logo on their sign is going to be a cross with a tongue of flame next to it. It’s not like a Klan thing, it’s not a burning cross, it’s the tongues of flame that represent the Holy Spirit, right. And then of course the Pentecostal church is so-called because their denomination focuses on connection through the Holy Spirit and the movement of the Holy Spirit within people. And it makes you shake on the floor, or whatever. So yea, Pentecost, a bigger deal for some denominations than others, I guess is what I'm getting at. But it's a very significant day for the history of the apostles. 

Chris: So they get the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit returns for them to hang out, I guess, in there. Like it is very much presented like the Force. Like they can use it for things.

Benito: Yeah, it's not just the thing where every Christian suddenly has it and can do all these things, because we see some of the other believers trying to do it. It is specifically the apostles and then their closest followers who actually have powers associated with the Holy Spirit.

Chris: So the first thing they decide to use the Holy Spirit is to create communism. It says, again this is the HCSB translation, Acts 4:34-35 “For there was not a needy person among them, because all those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles’ feet. This was then distributed for each person’s basic needs.” That's literally the definition of communism. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. 

Benito: Yea and it follows what Jesus says in the gospel. Jesus says “Go sell your stuff, give the money to the poor, you don't need anything, leave it, follow me, your needs will be taken care of. You don't need to own property.” Like that’s legit, that’s the early church. The point where, we see here in chapter 5 the story of Ananais and Saphira. 

Chris: I was excited about this story. It's pretty dope. 

Benito: We got the story, we got this guy Ananais and his wife Saphira. They are followers, they are members of the church. They have a piece of property, they sell it, and as it says, he kept back part of the proceeds with his wife's knowledge and brought a portion of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet. You know, he goes about it halfway, right. I'm going to partially do what you said, I’m going to be a partial communist, gonna keep a few things in my own pocket cuz, you know, bootstraps, et cetera. And then Peter’s like “Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? And keep back part of the proceeds from the field?” And he dies. 

Chris: He doesn’t die, he is struck dead by the Holy Spirit. 
Benito: Yeah, he heard these words he dropped dead, and a great fear came on all who heard. Young men got up, wrapped his body, carried him out, and buried him. 

Chris: And we know that it wasn't just like, oh he was caught in a lie, had a heart attack and dropped because then Saphira shows up and Peter’s like, “Hey, was this all the money from the sale of your land?” And she was like “yeah pretty sure”, and he's like “well, I’m pretty sure the Holy Ghost is gonna strike you dead”. Which happens.

Benito: It happens. Yeah. It is wild to read that, right, like God is literally murdering people for not being sufficiently socialist, and look at how far we’ve come. Look how far we've come. 

Chris: Yeah dude, that is shocking. It was very surprising to me to find out. First of all, I feel like if the pope could call down the Holy Spirit, because Peter’s the first pope. Right. If the pope could call down the Holy Spirit, like strike down enemies of the church, I feel like the history of Western Civilization takes a dramatic turn. 

Benito: Yeah there's definitely some popes in the Middle Ages, who, if they had that power to kill people with mind bullets, they would have. For sure. Like literally you have - 

Chris: Certainly an Avignon. 

Benito: I was going to say, popes and anti-popes. That would have been wild. Magic popes vs. anti-popes flying around, zapping each other with tongues of flame. European History AP. Take me away. 

Chris: And I feel like we would have heard about that. 

Benito: Yeah, I feel like we would have. 

Chris: So Peter’s full communism. Like full on sell your land, let's get going comrades. Apostles of the world unite. And everybody's pretty into this. Stephen’s pretty into it. So into it, that he gets stoned.

Benito: Yeah, but you know, not that kind of stoned. Stephen is an interesting character in that like, he's not a thing before this. Like who is Stephen? I don't know. Well he suddenly shows up, he's one of these seven deacons basically, that are chosen by the apostles to be these other ministers. Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit. And then all these other guys. And Stephen gets accused of blasphemy. He gives a big speech, it’s the longest speech in the entire book of Acts. Stephen gets more floor time then even Paul or James, who speaks later, and then they throw rocks at him until he is dead. Which makes him the first Christian martyr. That’s what he’s largely remembered for. He only appears in this basically one chapter. A chapter and some change in Acts. 

Chris: Well in the special edition he’s going to be a force ghost. 

Benito: Oh absolutely. Yeah. This is the Saint Stephen that we remember on December 26th, right, if you remember Good King Wenceslas looked out on the Feast of Stephen, that's this guy. I did want to note I have a somewhat personal connection to Stephen, in that when I was 10 or 11 years, probably 10, I sang a song in church all about Stephen, and it has stuck with me. It was not like a hymn, or anything, it was not a traditional song, it was what could very easily be called a contemporary Christian song. Not at all a Christian rock song, do not be confused, this was a song by guy named Ray Boltz, who I probably, his biggest hit song was one called “Thank You”, which is a weird kind of, like, self-congratulatory song about a guy who dreams he goes to Heaven, and all these people come up and are like “Oh, you taught my Sunday school and you saved my life I'm in Heaven cuz of that” like that's the premise of the song. He also wrote a song called, very excellently, “I Pledge Allegiance to the Lamb”. Not a common song, actually, but this song is called “Someone Stood Up for Stephen”, and so it's one of those that like, still pops up in my head. It does the the whole story of like, getting stoned, and the sky opens up and the clouds rolled away, someone saw Stephen, and then someone stood up for Stephen because Stephen stood up for him.

Chris: Aw that’s a very good personal testimony. So here’s the thing I like about the bit about Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr. He dies. He gets - they throw rocks at them until he’s dead, but I like the bit right after that, because it’s totally like dude turning towards the camera, cuz the next sentence after the death of Stephen is “Saul agreed with putting him to death.” So it’s like “Oh hey, Saul, remember him.” 

Benito: We straight up transition from like “Here's this guy we just introduced him, and we killed him off immediately, but we really did that so that we can pan up and you can see the guy standing on the edge, like, nodding approvingly. By the way, he’s gonna get the character arc, he’s the main character of this book actually. We’re 8 chapters in, but he's the actual main character of this book.” 

Chris: Here’s Darth Saul, with his double-bladed lightsaber, that he is going to be using to breathe murder against the the Christian. But before we get into more Saul story, we take a little detour to Simon Magus. 

Benito: Yeah, boy, so - 

Chris: One paragraph. He exists in one paragraph. I guess it’s more than one paragraph. He’s in Acts 8:9 through 8:25. That is it. 

Benito: That's it. We see him, they introduced him, and they say “hey there’s this guy Simon, he was a Sorcerer, by the way, he's a Christian now, but he was a sorcerer” and the main thing that was in the canonical Bible, there's one thing that he does, and basically he tries to bribe his way to Holy Spirit powers. He's like “how much will it cost for me to get that good good tongue of flame” and for that his name, you know if we're strictly following the Canon, he inspires the sin that is known as simony. Named after him. So it’s just “Simon” with a “y” on the end of it. Simony. And the idea is you try to pay for a higher position in the church, right, if you were like how much is it, you know, if I slip you a $20 could I be in Archbishop or whatever. Right, like, that would be the idea. 

Chris: You're going to want to remember that if you ever study, let's just say, the period between like 800 AD and, about like the, charitably, we’ll say the 20th century. 

Benito: Yeah there’s no shortage of simony, especially among popes in the Middle Ages. Yeah. 100%. 

Chris: Probably the big one's going to be your Alexander the Sixth. On that front. The Borgia boys.

Benito: Yeah a couple of notable ones there. That’s what we see of him in the Bible. Of the canonical scriptures, that's it. However, like, his name stands out to us. Like people know the name Simon Magus to the point where he fought the Justice League, right, Simon Magus fought the Justice League.  You don't just pick a guy who tried to buy superpowers. He appears in like 16 verses, and then you're like, “yeah that's the guy I want to fight the Justice League”. No, because Simon Magus is a much bigger deal once you look outside of the canonical scriptures. We will come back to him. We’re gonna put a little pin, a little pin in that boy right now, we’ll come back to him because we have plenty more to say about Simon Magus, but I did want to point out, like I said in the beginning, we were talking about the book. He’s not the only evil wizard in the book. Like he doesn’t even do wizard stuff. He tries to do bribery, which is the worst spell I've ever seen. Like they don't even teach it at Hogwarts. Like I don't know. Like the cool thing is, like I was saying earlier, Simon Magus is not even the only evil wizard in the book. We get to see Peter confront Simon Magus here in chapter 8, but then later in chapter 13 we see Paul confront his own evil wizard, whose name even means “evil wizard” so pretty good and convincing from Chapter 13 Verse 8 “But Elymas the sorcerer (this is the meaning of his name) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith. Then Saul, also called Paul, stared straight at the sorcerer and said ‘You son of the Devil, full of all deceit and all fraud, enemy of all righteousness! Won’t you ever stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord? Now, look! The Lord’s hand is against you. You are going to be blind, and will not see the sun for a time.’ Suddenly a mist and darkness fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.” So he blinds a guy.

Chris: That sounds an awful lot like the last bit of “Witches Invitation” to me. Minus the blinding.

Benito: Yeah, it sure does. Do you think Elymas the Sorcerer had Dungeons & Dragons in his house? I don't know. 

Chris: Probably so, and a ouija board.

Benito: He probably did. 

Chris: Now you brought something up that I was very frustrated with, even reading the HCSB, which is a modern translation, that’s still being updated and gone through and which is that everybody’s got two names, but there're only like eight names total. 

Benito: Yeah it's true that there were a number of very common names, especially Hebrew names. Like there's so many guys named Judas, it’s really weird and like, unfortunate that Judas is also the name of, like, the biggest human villain of the New Testament, because as we saw, it's also the name of another Apostle. 12 Apostles but there's only like 6 names among those 12 guys because there's two Simon's, right, our boy Simon The Rock Peter, there's two, well once Matthias joins, I mean that's “Matthew”, right, there’s two Matthews, there’s two Judases, you know sometimes you end up with - there’s two Jameses, and so that’s part of the reason why you get “so-and-so, also called so-and-so”, right, part of the reason is that what really was going on there in most cases, Peter was the exception we’ll come back to that in a second, in most of those cases what's going on is those people have a Hebrew name, and that name could be John, or James, these are the Anglicized versions of Hebrew names like “Yohanan” and “Ya’aqov”, right, but you have John or James or Simon those are Hebrew names. But because Judea was part of the Roman Empire at this time, many of the people also had Greco-Roman names, so they might have a Greek name like Andrew or Phillip. Those are Greek names, or they might have a Latin name. like in the case of John Mark, right, “John also called Mark” John would be his Hebrew name. “Mark” is “Marcus”, right almost quintessentially Roman name, and so probably the key example is Paul, right, who kind of takes over the book coming up here pretty soon, he's famously known as “Saul” when we first see him, very soon they refer to him as “Paul” and in a lot of places, you might see people say that that is an indication of his transition from Pharisee, where we see him at the beginning, to after his conversion, he starts going by “Paul” which first of all, that doesn't make any sense. Why would he do that? Why would he be like “Well I’m a Christian now, so I'm going to make my name a thing that rhymes with my real name”? I don't know. And it also doesn't line up with the chronology. So Saul is a Hebrew name, it's the name of the first king of Israel. King Saul. And Paul is a Roman name, right, it’s Latin. “Paulus”. It's the name that then gives us like “Pablo”, right. And so he probably, in that case, he probably chose Paulus as his Roman name, possibly because it sounds similar to Saul, but what we actually see is he starts using Paul not when he becomes a Christian, but rather when his mission turns outward to communicating to Gentiles, right, trying to spread the message to the Greeks. And so when he’s trying to effectively communicate with Greeks, he starts using his Greek name. That makes sense, right?

Chris: I guess we need to get to get to Paul, because this is a story so important that it is told, in its entirety, twice in the span of about eight pages. 

Benito: Three times, all told. Three times, we get the origin recap of Paul on the road to Damascus, which makes me ask the question “Was this book edited by Jim Shooter?” Every chapter could be someone's first chapter. 

Chris: It is pretty weird, cuz I don't think, even though we've been at this for like an hour now, I don't feel like people usually, like, leave off in the middle of books of the Bible, and need to come back and be like “hey everybody, just to bring you up, Paul is on the road to Damascus and was struck blind.” 

Benito: And it was Jesus. Jesus was the light, and then he saw the error of his ways during the time period in which he could not see anything else. Three times we see that story. 

Chris: So this is a pretty famous story, this is every face-turn, every villain giving it all up and deciding to be a hero is usually referred to as a “Damascus moment”, sometimes even canonically. If you come from comics like we do, famously, Emma Frost in the grimoire [unintelligible] on X-Men refers to becoming a good guy as her “Paul on the road to Damascus moment”. Now here’s what's weird about Paul. It says, shortly before this, in fact it's the first part of - it’s chapter 9 verse 1 “Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord.” Which is a great opening sentence for a new chapter. This may be the finest use of “meanwhile” I’ve ever heard.

Benito: “Meanwhite, back at the bat cave, Saul was breathing threats! And murder!”

Chris: Saul is pretty super into persecution of early Christians. He gets equally into the Lord, like in about five minutes. I guess it’s probably like a hour. It's a long road from Damascus. 

Benito: Yeah he is definitely one of those guys that, like, moves from obsession to obsession for sure, right, like he is pretty hardcore into the persecution of Christians. We do learn later that he is a member of the Pharisees, the guys who were kind of in a way the major villains of the gospels. The Pharisees, they were religious sect, arguably also a political party, at this time. Their main thing was strict adherence to the law, right, and so that's why they didn't like Jesus, because Jesus was like “Hey whatsup it's all about faith. The law, you'll follow the law if your faith is there.” They didn't care for that, that was kind of like, their major thing. We learn that Paul is a Pharisee, so he would have been super into strict and conservative interpretations of the Jewish religion. We also learn, significantly, that he is a Roman citizen, which he would have earned through his father or his grandfather, or something, who would have earned this citizenship through some favor of, you know, the emperor or something like that. 

Chris: So this leads to my favorite part of the book of Acts, even more favorite than Judas exploding, even more favorite than the set up of evil wizards that’s gonna come back in the expanded universe. Paul is super into whatever he's doing, he’s like “Yes, throw more rocks at Stephen. Thank you. I'm going to breathe some threats and murder. Let's do this.” He becomes a Christian and then immediately is like, “everybody, y’all need to get into Jesus” and starts like, going around basically yelling at people about that.

Benito: Yeah, the entire world. He goes around basically the entire known world at that point, yeah.

Chris: To the point where other Jews are like “Hey, you need to stop, because we don't believe that Jesus was the Messiah, like this is wrong, you are basically spreading heresy.” And he's like “well, I want to be tried by Romans, then, I’m Roman, it’s my right to be tried in a court. So if you wanna take this to court, let’s go to court.” And they do. And so we get my favorite character in the Bible thus far, which I believe is probably gonna be a recurring segment. And that is Festus. Festus rolls up, he’s a judge, and he has heard that someone has committed crimes that requires the intervention of a Roman judge. Now Benito you would be more familiar with this than I am, is this like a rare event that like, a judge would have to, like, sit down and hear a crime? Because it seems like he is coming to specifically to address this from another place. Like he doesn't know what's been going on in Judea. 

Benito: No, he would be in Judea. He's actually a little bit more than a judge, he’s the full-on magistrate. He's basically the governor. The Roman governor of Judea, at this point. Like he is the second one that Paul encounters. The first one is, he’s first taken to trial in front of a guy named Felix, but Felix basically gets fired because he does a terrible job. Like his main job is to moderate disagreements between Romans and Jews, right, and he does a bad job of that, so he gets fired, and he gets replaced by your boy Festus. So he’s considerably higher than a judge. He’s basically the Roman governor of Judea at this time. So it's a pretty big deal, and the only reason he gets brought in, is because of the fact that Paul has that Roman citizenship. Otherwise they would literally - if he were just a Judean, they would literally, if he were on trial, they would beat him. They would whip him before he could give testimony which is the thing that Romans used to do with slaves no matter what, because they always assumed that is slave or a non-citizen, would be a hostile witness, and they would need to be tortured in order to give true testimony. So they almost do that to him, and then he’s like “hold up y'all, Roman citizen right here” and they were like “ohhhh snap” and they'd get to take him to Festus. So yeah.

Chris: So Festus rolls up, and apparently all he’s heard is there is a crime committed by a Roman citizen that requires his intervention. 

Benito: Yeah, and he naturally assumes, he’s like, ohhhh someone is fomenting Revolution, someone is - 

Chris: Yeah like we’ve got like, revolution, we’ve got like, sedition, we’ve got a serial killer

Benito: And that’s a complete natural thing for him to think at this point in history, right, like if you seen “The Life of Brian” the jokes there about the United People's Front of Judea and all that stuff that's all real, right, all these like competing, different factions of people who want to rebel against the Romans, like here we're only few years out from like, the real for real Jewish Revolution that’s ultimately overthrown by the emperor Titus. Like that's coming up right in 70 AD. So we're here in the early 60s, so we're not far away from that, so it’s completely normal for Festus to assume that they're bringing in a revolutionary leader.

Chris: So Festus hears the case, and then he goes to talk to some friends of his. And look. We say at the top of every show, we are nonbelievers. And I think because of that, I think we are at an understanding where the Bible is not necessarily the most reliable source of historical accuracy, because it's a sacred text. It's a religious text, that's what it's focus is on. There is nothing that has made me - there is nothing that has seemed as accurate as what Festus says -

Benito: It's Agrippa. So that’s Herrod Agrippa. He’s the King. He's the King of Judea, basically. He's the son of Herrod from the Christmas story. Right.

Chris: From the massacre of the innocents. 

Benito: Yeah that guy. So this is his son, and his wife is Bernice. 

Chris: So Festus goes and talks to his friends, who are some Romans named Agrippa and Bernice. So Festus is like coming through, and he stops and he talks to them. I don't think we get, like, the actual part of Festus hearing about the [unintelligible] like hearing the case, we just get him talking about it. And he goes “Alright, so get this. I was brought in to hear a crime, like, you know, murder, and instead they were basically debating their whole religion, and it seemed to center on this guy Jesus, who’s dead, but this guy Paul says he's alive. I don't know what to do with this. None of this is actually legal.” 

Benito: It's the best thing, because he's going in and - quick correction sorry - Bernice is Agrippa’s sister, not his wife, okay anyway - that one was on me sorry, but anyway. Yeah, he comes in and he’s like “I'm expecting a revolution, instead, it's a group of guys and a guy arguing about whether a different guy is dead or alive. This guy Jesus.” His questions are, he's like “I have two questions, one, who is Jesus, two, why does anyone care?” 

Chris: Here’s the way it’s actually phrased in the book of Acts chapter 25 verse 19 “Instead they had some disagreements with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, a dead man Paul claimed to be alive.” I love this because I find early Christianity very fascinating. My wife has a degree in the study of early Christianity. But I love this dude, who’s showing up, after Jesus, and has never heard of it, and he just rolls up and he's like “yeah…” like he's very confused by the entirety of this weird commune, and dudes talking about this dead guy who may or may not be alive. This dude who was recorded to be executed by the Roman Empire, but then this other, this Paul, who’s I'm sure shouting at him, is talking about how he is alive, and probably being like “nonono you don’t understand, I went blind!” 

Benito: Yeah, and he gets so mad. Paul goes “I demand to see Caesar, I gotta see Caesar, Caesar or nobody. Caesar or no one.” And then later, they're like “if he had not said Caesar’s name, he would be free right now, but we gotta send him to Rome, because he demanded it.”

Chris:  Right, like he's about to hand out “not guilty, no crime has been committed” and instead my dude is like “take me to the emperor it’s my right” 

Benito: Right he’s got it written down, he’s got N-O-T G-U-I-L-T- and is in the middle of the Y and Paul’s like “Caesar please” and he’s gotta crumple up the paper and toss it in the fire.

Chris: It’s just so great because I love the fact that this is not, you know, we don't see the trial scene, this is not Festus making an announcement to the apostles, this is not Festus speaking directly to Paul. This is Festus with his bros being like “you will not believe what happened at work today”, and that's the most relatable thing in the book of Acts. Is a guy going to work and somebody's yelling at him and he doesn't know why. Festus is setting the mark to beat.

Benito: For sure, he’s good. Oh I forgot, I have a very good fact that I think will endear Festus to you even more, that I wanted to mention. Guess what his name means. 

Chris: I assume it has something to do with the word “festering”, is it the same root?

Benito: “Festering”? No the word you should be thinking of is “festival”, or “fiesta”, those are the related words you should be thinking of. 

Chris: Is his name “party dude”? 

Benito: It is “party dude”.

Chris: Party Dude is my favorite dude in the Bible, it's like, it's going to take a lot to beat him. I mean I know eventually we’re going to be reading about the literal son of God, but Festus is pretty tight.

Benito: We also see Romans at this time would have had three names, we don't know what his first name is. We see that his family name is “Porcius” well “Porcius” is the clan name, “Festus” is a family name. His name is “Porky Party Dude”. Porky Party Dude, is his name. Yeah he’s pretty good.

Chris: So the rest of the book, basically like Paul. Is like, is his journey to Rome to go talk to Caesar. And you know the ship gets wrecked because there's a storm, and Paul’s like, “don't worry, I know we've been trapped on the Sea of Galilee for a while, but you guys go ahead and eat your food, the Lord is going to provide.” And then they go to Malta, and everybody's nice. 

Benito: Right. So yeah this is traditionally considered to be Malta, because in Greek it is referred to as “Melite” and so we go “oh this must be Malta”, except like geographically it doesn’t quite work out, but whatever, it's fine. It doesn't matter. But I did want to mention something about the trip to Malta because of something very interesting. We have here in chapter 28, verse 3, we're on Malta after the ship has wrecked. “As Paul gathered a bundle of brushwood and put it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself to his hand. When the local people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man is probably a murderer, and though he has escaped the sea, Justice does not allow him to live!” However, he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm. They expected that he would swell up or suddenly drop dead. But after they waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.” 

Chris: These people are very quick to jump to conclusions. 

Benito: They really are. But do you know what we have just witnessed, just now in that passage, what we just saw? 

Chris: I do. We have witnessed the first appearance and origin of snake handling. 

Benito: That is the birth of snake church. We just saw it. That passage right there is exactly the reason that modern-day super fundy guys, they fully believe that they can handle a snake and even get bitten by a snake, and they'll not be not be harmed because of their extreme faith in Christ. Just like our boy Paul. This passage is the birth of snake church. 

Chris: So Paul ends up going to see Caesar. We don’t get that here. That's going to be - again, that's in the expanded universe, but he rents a house, he stays two years, and he proclaims the kingdom of God and the teaching of the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ in full boldness and without hindrance. And this is after we get an update on the book of Isaiah which we also see in Matthew 13:14. It’s drawn from Isaiah 6:10, it comes back here, in the final book of Acts, which is book 28 verse 27, “The Holy Spirit correctly spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors when He said, ‘Go to these people and say: You will listen and listen, yet never understand; and you will look and look, yet never perceive. For the hearts of these people have grown callous, their ears are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and be converted, and I would heal them.’” It is one of those chapters like John 3:16, like the fool has said in his heart there is no God, that is one that often gets brought up in a very weaponized scripture sort of way by people attempting to convert you, which is that you know, if you would just open your heart, you'd let him in, as though it's your fault for not hearing it correctly. 

Benito: Yeah, and that’s essentially the message from when Isaiah, in Isaiah these are the words of God to Isaiah, like “look man I'm assigning you this message of judgment and punishment and the people are not gonna like it, so you should be prepared for that”, and so that's the parallel here, right, Paul’s message as well is one where he's going to have some difficulty spreading it, it's going to be things that people don't want to hear.

Chris: It seems again, we're getting a pretty good picture of Paul. He’s a dude who’s super into it, like he's very extra, he's going to go zero to a hundred, he's going to get himself into trouble, and then if you don't like it well then, that’s your problem, I’m just asking questions, that's your problem. You need to open your eyes and your ears, because I’m just telling you the word. That’s Paul. Which, I was having a conversation with somebody who was like “yeah I don't like Paul” because the first thing we see him do is, he’s telling people how to worship God and telling them they're getting it wrong. He's struck blind, and then when he recovers he's like, back to telling people how to worship God and they’re doing it wrong. Yeah, he's an extreme dude.

Benito: As we get more into modern times, I think Paul is experiencing a pretty significant critical re-evaluation, and he's not coming out the better for it, I think. 

Chris: Paul is exactly the dude who would invite you to a pizza party. To a porky party.

Benito: He’d be throwing the pizza party. The ending seems a little bit strange, right, because we know that there's more that comes afterward. So obviously some would argue the fact that it ends here means the book must have been written around this time. But on the other hand, if you think about, you know, the thesis that I was talking about of the book, the idea of the spread of Christianity from being a splinter sect of Judaism to becoming the religion of the Gentiles, it make sense to end with Paul in Rome “with full boldness and without hindrance”, right, because you end up in this like -

Chris: Oh we need to talk about the dream. And so there’s a part before this that we skipped over a little bit. Is it Paul who has the dream or is it?

Benito: Ah yes yes yes that’s Peter. 

Chris: So the reason that Paul is sent to go, basically go to Rome and start preaching to the Romans, to the point where like 500 years later Christianity will be the official state religion of Rome. Is that Peter has a dream, and people don't like that Peter is taking this Messianic splinter sect of Judaism and bringing it to Gentiles and trying to convert them. Because they're not in the religion, they don't have the context, they don't have the background, and Peter's like “Check it, I had this dream though, and it actually was a prophecy.” In his room he has a vision of all the animals in the world being lured on a white sheet. I imagine them on the roof of a building. And God shows up, and he's like “Hey Peter, why don’t you snack on these animals?” And Peter's like “I mean, thanks but no thanks, I don't eat anything that is unclean because, you know, that’s scripture.” And that’s a buckwild thing to say to God, by the way.

Benito: And God does reply, he's like “hey how dare you to tell me what's unclean, I'm telling you to go eat that bat”, or whatever, “go eat a bat, or a frog” 

Chris: “Check out these pigs and shellfish”  

Benito: “These very sweet hippopotamus steaks I have prepared for you” 

Chris: So God says “What I have made can not be condemned, like, I made it I'm God, like it's okay.” And then Peter says that he sees this repeat three times, which I imagine is being like those bits in Dragon Ball Z where like, somebody gets hit and they show it like real-quick, real-quick, and then slow-mo, like the same action. So this is like, the final anime. 

Benito: Yeah, for sure. And so, yeah. Of course, the metaphor here is the idea that the message of Christ is not just for the Jewish people. It's intended for the Greeks, as well the nations, and even though he would have shied away from that because he would have thought of those people as unclean, God is like “No man, I made this for everybody. I also made everybody. They're not unclean, you need to spread this message.” It is also often used as the justification for why most Christians do not follow dietary laws; they are not kosher, right, because here God lowered a big sheet full of bats and whales and whatever and told Peter to eat em. So if he's telling Peter to eat a metaphorical bat - 

Chris: Hold on, hold on, wait. My guy, are you telling me that Peter, The Rock, upon whom the church is built, was like sitting there going like what do I need to do? I've got the message, you know, but how do I bring it to the masses? What do I do? And then he saw a bat, and said “yes Father”? 

Benito: Yeah! 

Chris: Peter might end up being my favorite. Naw it’s gonna be Festus. It’s gonna be Festus. It’s gonna be Porky Party. 

Benito: And so anyway, yeah. There's your call-to-action right there, that's the turning point in the mission. And so yeah, you know, the message here of the book is like “Hey, wasn't this a Jewish thing? Why is it all Greeks and Romans now?” And the story shows, like, well we offered it to the Jews, and they were like “no thanks” and they killed all our dudes. And so we were like “What about these Greek boys?” And that's what happened. So yeah, I mean like, that's the message there, and it also kind of shows you got a foundation of anti-Semitism going all the way to the back. All the way back to the beginning.

Chris: Yeah, I was really surprised at how often they kinda go like “oh, yea, The Jews” in this book. It seemed a little like, oh this is where it comes from, okay. 

Benito: Right and so this actually ties into a thing I wanted to ask you about. Getting to the end of this book, reading it from front to back, as I know you did, multiple times -

Chris: I took a highlight to it! 

Benito: Nice. Very nice. Who did you take away as the main dudes of Christianity at the end of this book? If you had to narrow, like, whittle it down, who are the main dudes? 

Chris: Okay, main dudes of Christianity. Obviously it's Peter and Paul. Those are the guys.

Benito: Peter and Paul. They’re the two saints. Right, like, if you hear the phrase “two saints” somewhere, even, what's his name of the producer from Justice League, Joaquin Dos Santos, Johnny Two Saints. Right? Like, those are the two saints. Peter and Paul. If you go to Rome and you see two saints together, you know who those boys are, you know it's Peter, you know it’s Paul. They’re the guys. To quote Laser Swords: The Movie - “there is another”. There is another very significant Church leader who is basically minimized in the book of Acts, and that is James. Not James the Great, we do see James the Great, he is the first of the Apostles to get martyred, we see him get killed back in chapter 12, this is the one known as James the Just. And who exactly James the Just is is a matter of very debate. He could be James the Less, also James the son of Alphaeus that we saw one of the disciples - Apostles. But more likely, James the Just is also known as “James the Brother of God”, so potentially, James the brother of Jesus himself. That is obviously a matter of debate because Catholics believe in The Perpetual Virginity of Mary. They do not believe that Mary had any other children. Protestants, however, most as far as I'm aware do not have issue with interpreting the four brothers and multiple sisters of Jesus as being his literal, you know, full-blooded or whatever, brothers and sisters, and -

Chris: Not know whole, right, half. 

Benito: Right, half. There's a number of ways around this within Catholic tradition, there's not an official doctrine. It could be that James was Joseph’s son from a previous marriage and thus was older than Jesus, it could be that, some Catholics will teach that the word “brothers” means “cousin”, it doesn't matter. That’s a debate for when we get to the Book of James, right. The point is James the Just. We do see him in the book, he shows up a number of times. He’s the head of the church of Jerusalem, he’s the head of the, like, original Christian Church and thus he’s one of the most influential and important of the early Christians. His role is mega-downplayed in the book of Acts, and one of the reasons for that is he and Paul were at theological loggerheads. James is the head of the Church of Jerusalem, which was a much more traditional Jewish-focused guy. The Book of James that we see here that's an epistle here in the New Testament, that's very, it's notorious, I guess or infamous for the fact that it causes some trouble because it really focuses on the idea of “works” versus “faith”. So James has a more traditional Jewish perspective, he's focused on the idea of the law, and following the law, and that if you love God, you will follow his commandments, right, whereas Paul is all about, like, well faith comes first, if you have faith, then theoretically your actions will follow, right. So these guys were totally at loggerheads, and the fact that James is downplayed kind of makes sense when you realize that this book was potentially written by one of Paul’s best friends. So in a lot of ways, this book that we've read is pro-Paul propaganda. Prop-Paul-ganda. 

Chris: So this is the origin of sola fide doctrine. 

Benito: Yeah, that's a very Pauline kind of idea that you get later with Luther. Yeah, it's a very Paul idea for sure. 

Chris: Which makes so much sense, for a guy who is defined by having a moment in which his faith has changed, that he then goes hard in the paint getting people in on it. Maintains pretty much the same actions. He does not encourage any further stonings that we know of in the book of Acts, but he certainly like, is, like, still operating, like wide-open, 100% at all times, no chill. So yeah that is the Book of Acts, everybody. Now there is some additional stuff that I think we're going to have to get to in another episode, when we dive into the expanded universe, aka the Apocrypha. We're going to see these two boys come back in the acts of Peter and Paul, which is the apocryphal book which has the return, and one of the deaths of, Simon Magus. That’s right. Your favorite minor villain is going to make his way back, and believe me when I tell you it’s dope. 

Benito: Yeah, it really is. And despite being an apocryphal book the acts of Peter and Paul is hugely influential on Christian belief and depictions in art. And we’ll learn that, as the more we look at apocryphal books, we’ll see that even though these things didn't make the cut, it didn’t mean that people didn't still believe in them and take a lot of things away from them. 

Chris: Keep in mind, that’s 300 years of teachings, plus another couple hundred years it took to make its way around. It's not like they just, you know, tossed them all into the fire. The stories still existed, not to mention all the stories of saints that came after in the early days and then in the Middle Ages after the collapse of the empire. The Western Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire, we all know, is maintained for another thousand years.

Benito: That’s correct, very good. 

Chris: Look, like I said, I like history. I’m just not great at the Bible. Now if we were smart, or doing this properly, we would probably dive into the acts of Peter and Paul next time. Next time. Because that is a direct sequel to Acts. Instead, we're not doing that. What we're going to do in this podcast going forward is, we’re probably going to alternate between New Testament books and Old Testament books, at least until we run out of New Testament books, we’ll probably mix the Apocrypha in there somewhere. So next time you hear us talking about the New Testament, maybe it'll be Romans, maybe it'll be acts of Peter and Paul, and we'll get into that stuff. But next time we are together for another service we will be getting into a book that I picked, Benito, you picked this one, our second book was my pick, and we'll be reading Daniel, because it has a story I know. 

Benito: Right. And little did you know what you were really picking. 

Chris: Yeah, it’s pretty good. So if you would like to read along with us, once again, it's the Bible. It's available pretty much everywhere. You can check it out on Bible Gateway if you're interested in a specific translation. Again, we're using the Holman Christian Standard Bible but if you want to read along in The New International Version, King James, those are much more easy to find but it's all online at Bible Gateway. And other websites. But before we get out of here, do you have a favorite verse from, a favorite excerpt, from the scripture?

Benito: For sure, my particular favorite story and bit from the book of Acts comes in Chapter 19 Verse 13 where we see a host of itinerant professional exorcists going around, casting out demons in the name of Jesus, who they don't even know who Jesus is, they’re basically using his name like a magic word. And they’re the Seven Sons of Sceva, and when they cast out the demon “The evil spirit answered them, “I know Jesus, and I recognize Paul—but who are you?” Then the man who had the evil spirit leaped on them, overpowered them all, and prevailed against them, so that they ran out of that house naked and wounded.” 

Chris: That definitely seems like Paul throwing in “by the way they also knew me. By the way I am the Captain America of this situation. Not a founder, but the most important of the early days, obviously.” My reading is going to come from the section on Simon Magus its chapter 8 verse 21 through 23, and I should say that I said this a couple weeks ago, which is forever in internet time, there was that “Brooklyn Barbecue is taking over the world” article, and as a Southerner, that was anathema to me, so when my wife showed it to me, I said to her, or I said to the creators of Brooklyn BBQ, “You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God. Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. For I see you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity.” 

Benito: Preach. 

Chris: And I think it says a lot that your favorite verse in Acts was about itinerant professional exorcists, and mine is someone yelling at another one for being bound by iniquity. Alright that’s it for the first episode of Apocrypals, join us next time for the book of Daniel. We’ll see you then. And until then, I have been Chris Sims, with Benito Cereno. Benito, peace be with you.

Benito: And also with you.
